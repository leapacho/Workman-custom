Workman keyboard layouts
========================

Workman keyboard layout originally proposed by OJ Bucao at https://workmanlayout.org.

This is Limonero's fork, which adds many keys involving the Spanish language, such as diacritics, the N tilde, and more. You can check out the changes in the included layout image.

When learning cold-turkey, try printing the included keyboard image as a desk reference.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING ⚠️

**Only the Xorg version (in the Xorg folder) has been modified. Other versions have been left untouched.**

## Important design notes

The original Workman-P proposal by OJ Bucao sought to reverse keys for backtick (`) and brackets ([]), however when considering the Objective-C and PHP programming languages, both make heavy use of the original, primary characters. Swapping them makes those frequent characters more work. **In this repository, only the number keys are reversed** to special characters.

Some of the original key mapping files written by OJ used Colemak positions for alternate/multi/dead key configurations, therefore all the configurations proposed by OJ on his wordpress blog have been modified and bug-fixed by David Norman and hosted at http://github.com/workman-layout/Workman.
